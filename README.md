# DremelLaserCutter
Support files for working with the Dremel DigiLab LC40 Laser Cutter.

I received my Dremel Digilab LC40 Laser Cutter in October of 2018. I've been playing and experimenting with it to understand the best work flows for using it and to find the best settings. I'll share files here that will help you get up and running quickly and eventually I'll share my favorite files for you to try out. 

## Contents:
* Illustrator File Template
* Laser Settings Template
* Illustrator Color Palette for vector lines
