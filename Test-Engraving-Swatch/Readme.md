# Test Engraving Swatch
These files provide a template to test engraving settings for different materials. I use it to get a feel for what color the laser will do at each setting, then I reference those colors when I'm choosing my laser settings for each file I cut. You can use the Illustrator file if you're using a non-Dremel laser cutter, or the PDFs if you want to set up your own Dremel file. Or you can use the Dremel file that already has the settings preset (with minor caveats - double check the engraving settings before sending it to the laser, it mixed some of the settings up.) 

This folder contains four files:
1. Test-Engraving.ai (Illustrator File)
2. Test-Engraving_Vector.pdf (vector cutting file)
3. Test-Engraving_Engrave.pdf (engraving file)
4. Test-Engraving.bin (Dremel cutting file)
  
  
Watch my Youtube video to see how I set it up.
  
Feel free to edit the Illustrator file to change the test swatch. You can add the name of the material, thickness, or whatever you want!
