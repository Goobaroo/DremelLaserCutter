# Laser Settings Test
These files provide a template to test engraving settings for different materials. I use it to get a feel for what color the laser will do at each setting, then I reference those colors when I'm choosing my laser settings for each file I cut. It requires a bit of set up in the Dremel software, but I'm hoping to add a Dremel file here once I get it all set up and done.

This folder contains three files:
1. Laser-Setting-Test.ai (Illustrator File)
2. Laser-Setting_Vector.pdf (vector cutting file)
3. Laser-Setting_Engrave.pdf (engraving file)
  
  
You can use the two PDFs to engrave and cut out a test swatch for each of your materials. Watch my Youtube video to see how I set it up.
  
Or you can edit the Illustrator file to change the test swatch. You can add the name of the material, or thickness.
